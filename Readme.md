<h1>A python script that reminds me to pay bills</h1>
<p> Why?? Because I am lazy and I do not go through all the mails I receive so I need someone to remind me to pay routine bills like broadband, landline etc
</p>
<hr>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>You have to enter 3 data regarding your bill<br>

<ul>
    <li>Bill name</li>
    <li>Bill description</li>
    <li>Bill due date(Just the day)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/RajNirmal/Python_Remainder/blob/master/items.json">this sample.</a>
<hr>
<br>Place the .py file and .json file a directory that will run it automaticallly when your machine starts up. There are a ton
of guides that teach you how to do that so I am not going to cover that.<br><br>

If you think the code sucks and can be improved branch it and do your thing<br><br>
